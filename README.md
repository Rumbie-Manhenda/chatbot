## An AI based chatbot using python, Tensorflow and Deep Learning
### Chatbot Application with Anthropic AI Integration

This project is a web-based chatbot application that allows users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot is built using Node.js and Express.js, and it integrates with the Anthropic AI language model API to generate natural language responses.

The application consists of a server-side component written in Node.js and a client-side component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The server-side code handles the communication with the Anthropic API, while the client-side code provides a user-friendly interface for users to send messages and receive responses from the chatbot.

Key Features:
- Natural Language Processing: The chatbot leverages the Anthropic AI language model to understand and generate human-like responses to user messages.
- Real-time Interaction: Users can engage in real-time conversations with the chatbot through a web-based interface.
- Error Handling: The application includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and provide appropriate feedback to users.
- Logging and Monitoring: The server-side code incorporates Winston for logging and monitoring purposes, ensuring efficient debugging and maintenance.
- Testing: The project includes unit tests written using Jest to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application.
